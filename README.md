# Welcome to My Printf
***
In order to pass the tests all functions were moved under my_printf as the header file was not being linked for some reason.

## Task
The task is to implement a simplified version of the printf function in C, called my_printf, 
that can handle format specifiers for integers, strings, characters, and pointers.

## Description
My Printf is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, which allows you to print formatted output to the standard output stream. The my_printf function supports the following format specifiers:

    %d: Print a signed integer in decimal format.
    %o: Print an unsigned integer in octal format.
    %u: Print an unsigned integer in decimal format.
    %x: Print an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format.
    %c: Print a single character.
    %s: Print a null-terminated string.
    %p: Print the value of a pointer in hexadecimal format (with the "0x" prefix).

## Installation
Copy the repository and run make all to compile my_printf. Make adjustment to main.c to run desired tests. 

## Usage
The my_printf function can be used in your C programs to print formatted output. 
Simply include the "my_printf.h" header file and call the my_printf function with the desired format string and arguments.
